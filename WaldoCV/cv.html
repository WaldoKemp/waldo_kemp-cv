It has always been my dream to become a software engineer/developer. Coding has grabbed my intension at a very young age. I am currently pushing myself to grow as a computer programmer by learning how to code. I am currently learning how to code in SQL, C#, JavaScript, Angular and Database management. I have also have experience on how to code in Delphi.
